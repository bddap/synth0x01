Hi ðŸ‘‹

This is where I dump some of my "music" synthesis experiments.

Some of the "music" is generated end-to-end in software; a program does everything from composing the song to writing audio samples to a file. I've also tried some aleatoric-type stuff.

If you care to subject your ears to the output of this synth, the best way is to compile and run the program yourself:

```bash
cd synth0x10
cat justfile
just play
```

Older experiments can be found in the git history.
